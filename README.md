# Smart Contract-Based Toll System 

This was the final project for [B9 Lab's](https://academy.b9lab.com/courses) Ethereum Developer course.

Project requirements found [here](https://github.com/lubintan/ETH_DEV_COURSE-exam/blob/master/EXAM_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Key Features:
* Designed and implemented Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity based on the given requirements.
* Optimized code to consume minimal gas and wrote code to be resistant against commonly known security vulnerabilities.
* Used a linked list to mitigate scalability issues.
* Wrote test cases in Truffle.
* Implemented a GUI to interact with the blockchain.

The main working repo for this project was originally hosted [here](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ETH-SUB-exam-projects/lubin-code/tree/master).
